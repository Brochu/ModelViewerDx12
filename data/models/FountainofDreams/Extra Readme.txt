A number of materials may need to be adjusted to use mirroring. The one's that do will need to have one of the following setups. 

For a material that should make a circle, you need to set U Offset to 0.5, Tiling to 0.5 and mirror set on wit V equivalents set to the same thing.

For a material that should just be mirrored horizontally, just use the settings for U that I wrote above and it should come out fine.

In addition, the water in this stage had a separate version of the level rendered and then textured onto it realtime. Basically, low poly versions of characters and items were rendered separately on that set and then drawn onto the water. The textures for the water that got ripped were probably for distorting it in some way or another more than anything else so its probably best if you use them that way.

Lastly, the skybox didn't rip at all. Its just a starry background, but its worth noting.
