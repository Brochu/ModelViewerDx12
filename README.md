# ModelViewerDx12
Personal project to make sure I fully understand how to setup a good C++ development environment on Windows for graphics programming. The goal is to have a more stable env this time.

I would like to re-implement the Monkey Ball map viewer so I have some good set of starting features. I would also like to use Dx12 this time in order to practice using a more recent graphics API.
Since Dx12 is a very lightweight API, I will start off of a hello world project found online.

The toolset I would like to use to compile and link this project

* Cmake
* Clang/Clangd

I would also like to link to the following libraries to help with development

* DirectX 12 (Main graphics API)
* ImGUI (Immediate mode UI)
* Assimp (Help to load 3d model files)
* Tracy (Performance profiling)

I would like to use the [Dx12 hello world project](https://gpuopen.com/learn/hellod3d12-directx-12-sdk-sample/) from GPUOpen to start off.
